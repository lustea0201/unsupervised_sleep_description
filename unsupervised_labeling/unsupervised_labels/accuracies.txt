- m00019 (): 88.2%, 94.1%, 75.0% -> 84.5% # HARD TO ANNOTATE (PAINFUL EYES -> CLOSED, INACTIVE =fragmented sleep)
-> give up this patient (won't be happy with ground truth anyways). 

SETTINGS: use all electrodes, bandpowers_n. Smoothing improves accuracy!

- m00023: 44.8% failed (short sleep and fragmented, but still an unacceptable fail) & 95.7% worked!
44.8%, 95.7% -> 67.3%
-> fragmented sleep and seizures make it hard, and hard to annotate. Doesn't explain why one works and not other. 
See if non-linearity can fix first folder, otherwise ignore this one (perf will still be unconvincing since
hard to label)

REMOVED FIRST FOLDER; (fragmented sleep, no delta pattern). 
COuld improve separation in cluster from other folder by deleting 3 problematic electrodes. 
-> works in that second folder. 

Settings: remove_bad_electrodes, definitely NEED relative bandpower. Also works if don't remove_bad electrodes; makes one folder better separated and the other worse.
Smooth but changes nothing. All_together fails.


- m00026: 100%. 
-> WORKS

SETTINGS: remove_bad_electrodes=True(fine otherwise too), NEED relative, 

- m00030: ? Probably well! MISSING EC9!, DOWNLOAD!!! RPOBLEM LOADING ??
TODO: CHECK if delat/theta can save the plotting situation!!
84.2% (kinda lucky! doesn't get the ende right... see if adding delta/theta helps!!!!!!!!!!!)
84.2%, 100% ->93%
->Works mostly, especially for second folder... 

SHOW this one because impresively works EVEN THOUGH no clear human visible delta pattern indicates it.
SETTINGS: drop_bad, NOT relative is better, all_together fails. Keep smoothing but doesn't change accuracy.
 

- m00032: 89.5%, 91.5%, 100% -> 92.7% (Only mistake is me, probably hadn't fallen asleep yet))
-> WORKS

SETTINGS: THIS ONE WORKS WELL IF KEEP ALL DATA; NOT FOLDERS SEPARATELY! Rel_n gives more separated, but worse performance... Go with that still!!
Smoothing not necessary but done.


- m00035: 80.3%. 
NOTE: there is a 3rd, obvious cluster. All the mistakes are awake -> classified as asleep.
Maybe this is like an "eyes closed" state ??? 
Have to do some of the clustering "manually"

Settings: better with bandpowers_n, kind of same so drop_bad. Smooth changes nothing so do it.





- m00039:
90% + 93.1% -> 91% :) used to not work so this is great!! Definitely 
Settings: need relative! and drop_bad, smooth not playing a big role. 



- m00043:
88.2, 88.9, 95.6, 71.4  -> ROUGHLY 89.4%... DO MISSING!!

Settings: need relative. Simpler if don't remove bad_electrodes.Smoothing worsened performance by 4%, but I want to stick to my principles. 



- m00044:
OK, this one actually fails miserably no matter what I do. Even if drop gamma. $
49.3, 83.3 -> 64.4%


- m00049:
Seems to also fail. HYPOTHESIS: recordings too long, split into 3 to make it work!!
83.6, 94.3 -> 88.7%
SETTINGS: really helps to not smooth... gained 10% accuracy so fuck it. 

- m00079:
Fine I guess, maybe annotations weren't perfect. 
SETTINGS: need relative. Better if keep bad electrodes. Smoothed but didn't change anything. 


- m00083:
92.9%
Settings: need relative! Doesn't matter if keep or drop bad. I smoothed but no change. 


- m00084:
88.9%, 95.5% -> 92.5%.

Smoothing worsened performance by 5%, but I want to stick to my principles.


WORKS! although had some doubts on some labels... happy with result.




- m10000: 98.1, 98.1, 100 -> 98.4%! :) 
Settings: remove_bad helps, relative is def better. Smoothing worsens a tiny bit but who cares. 


(- m10001)
(- m10002) 
- m10003: 98.1, 100, 90.1->94.2%
Note: Could consider trimming 5eae... ut doesn't affect accuracy. 
Settings:  rel_n or bandpowers_n work. Don't need to remove bad. 


- m00100: 100%!
Settings: remove bad, need rel_n, 

- m00097: 93.8%
Settings: should split first very long file in 2, better with relative,  removed bad

- m00096: 98.5%
Settings: split in 3, works better with bandpowers_n. Removed bad


- m00095: 91.0%
Settings: split in 4, rel,
Seems like it worked perfectly, but since used kmeans and clusters not obvious, I'll have to give medium confidence only.

- m00075: 90.9%
Need rel_n. Smoothing improves a bit 

- m00073: 98.3%
smoothing improves by 3-5%...

- m00071: 94.9%
Smoothing improves by 6%...
First folder: couldn't annotate. 
Settings: Rel_n

- m00068: 98.2%
Settings: best if keep some really bad electrodes. Either norm works. Didnt need to split long recording.

- m00061: 79.2%, 90.9% -> 84.8%
Settings: don't remove, use bp
Removed folder dcde because no video. 

- m00060: 89%
Settings: need to split a lot, and cropped a bit more to make it work better. 
Did not smooth. 


- m00059: 60, 89.5, 53.8, 83.3, 93.3->77.9%

Settings: bandpowers_n better than rel for this one.

- m00058: 
Settings: dont know, fails

- m00056: NO VIDEO

- m00055: 93.3%
Smoothed. Relative. 

- m00053:

- m00052: 70.3, 91.4 -> 81.3%
Not sure. SUPER HARD TO ANNOTATE (2 yo)

- m00048: 91.9%
Had to use bandpowers.

- m00047: 90.8%
didnt work so well, split in 2 and

- m00038: 95.7, 81.8 -> 87.5%
should remove first folder because no sleep ??
Doesn't work too well in general. 

- m00037: 96%. 
Deleted two folders because bad quality video, few periods of long sleep. 
Had to use bandpowers.


- m00033: 
ABSOLUTELY SHOULD REMOVE BAD! really many severe artifacts here. 


- m00024: -> 64.7, 79.2, 57.4, 77.3, 79.2% -> 69.4%
kept the bad because prefer that plot electrode but not sure!

- m00006: fails

- m00001: fails
